# Vivamyx

Vivamyx is an API for the PHP language which can be used to simplify the usage of PHP code.

Some developers may not completely understand the PHP documentation and certain keywords.
Therefore, Vivamyx can help these developers understand their code much better.

As of now, the Vivamyx project is nowhere complete.
It is just my side project for whenever I have time.
